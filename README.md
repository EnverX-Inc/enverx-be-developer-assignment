## _Assginment For Backend Developer Role_

### Instructions
``` diff
- Fork this repository
- Take a fresh `pull`
- Create a `development` branch
- `Push` the updated code after task completion
Note: Make sure to add proper `commit` messages
```

### Task Requirements
1. Create a RESTful API for a simple blog application.
2. Use Node.js and Express.js as the backend framework.
3. Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for blog posts.
4. Store the blog posts in a dB
5. Include validation for the API endpoints to ensure data integrity.
6. Implement error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
7. Use Git for version control and host the project on GitHub.
8. Write clear and concise documentation on how to set up and use the API.

### Functional Requirements
1. Set up a new Node.js project and initialize it with a package.json file.
2. Create the necessary Express.js routes and controllers for CRUD operations on blog posts.

> `GET /posts` - Get all blog posts.
> `GET /posts/:id` - Get a specific blog post by ID (Apply filters like gender, userId, age, etc).
> `POST /posts` - Create a new blog post.
> `PUT /posts/:id` - Update an existing blog post.
> `DELETE /posts/:id` - Delete a blog post.

3. Implement validation for the API endpoints to ensure the data is correct and complete.
4. Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for not found, 500 for server errors, etc.).
5. Test the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or cURL.
6. Write a README.md file with instructions on setting up the project, running it, and using the API.
7. Initialize a Git repository, commit your code regularly, and push it to GitHub.
8. Optionally, include any additional features or improvements you think would enhance the API.

### Setup the Project
1. Clone the "enverx-be-developer-assignment" repositry.
2. cd enverx-be-developer-assignment
3. npm i
4. create the .env file and assign the value to "connectionUrl"
5. npm run start
